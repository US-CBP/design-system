# Expand Pattern

## Purpose

The Expand component allows the user to expand hidden content (and collapse it again).

## Functional Requirements

 * This component is functionally similiar to the Accordion component with a different visual treatment meant for shorter content and possibly nesting within Accordions to show hierarchy.
* Focus on the title will be set to the `<button>` element that is in the `.cbp-expand__title` `<div>` element.

## Technical Specifications

### User Interactions

* Clicking on the title text will set focus to and trigger the click event of the `button` control, expanding or collapsing the content of the pattern.
* Keyboard navigation will set focus on the `button` control rather than the actual title text.

### Responsiveness

* Long titles will wrap and be spaced correctly so that wrapped text will fall under the text and not the button.

### Accessibility

* `aria-expanded` is placed on the `<button>` control and toggled via JavaScript with user interaction.
* `aria-controls` is placed on the `<button>` control, referencing the `id` of the Expand content wrapper (generated by the component).
* Since the actual `<button>` control does not contain a text label, an `aria-labelledby` attribute is placed on it automatically, referencing the adjacent text of the Expand title.

### Additional Notes and Considerations

* As mentioned above, the Expand component may be used within the Accordion to provide a visual hierarchy.
