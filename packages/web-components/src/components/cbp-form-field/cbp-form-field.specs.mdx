# cbp-form-field

## Purpose

The Form Field component represents a generic, reusable pattern for form fields of all types.

## Functional Requirements

* The Form Field component enforces the structure of an input pattern, containing:
  * A label
  * Description (or errors)
  * The native form control (input, select, textarea, etc.)
* The Form Field component encapsulates styles for all types of HTML form fields that may be slotted within, including various states such as:
  * readonly
  * disabled
  * error state
* TODO: The Form Field component can handle single fields or groups such as checklists, radio lists, or compound input patterns (e.g., phone, address).

## Technical Specifications

### User Interactions

* When a Form Field is activated by user interaction it emits a custom event that can be listened for.
* All `textarea` tags are resizable vertically up to a maximum of `80vh` (it should never exceed the screen height, which causes usability issues due to double scroll bars).

### Responsiveness

* Form controls such as text input, textarea, and selects are styled at 100% of their container by default, with a max-width of 100% so that they cannot break out of their container.

### Accessibility

* According to CBP Design System guidance, required fields should indicate "Required" in the field description in plain text.
  * The `required` attribute should not be used on the native form field because 1. screen readers would read "required" twice and 2. this attribute triggers browser-based validation, which will not behave consistently with application/custom validation.
  * Do not place `aria-required` on the native form field, as screen readers would read "required" twice.
* Disabled form controls and buttons are non-interactive and cannot be navigated to using the keyboard and should be used with caution (if at all).
* Placeholder text should rarely, if ever, be used.
  * Especially in forms where the user is expected to enter data, placeholder text with sufficient contrast to the background color may be mistaken as entered input.
  * In high contrast mode, placeholder text is displayed exactly the same as entered text, making this issue more likely.
  * Placeholder text disappears when the user starts typing in the field, creating more cognitive load than necessary.
* Form input patterns using this component and the optional `cbp-form-field-wrapper` component will be read in the following order by screen readers:
  1. Field label
  2. Form field
    * "Edit" or similar control description (e.g., "Spin Button")
    * If aria-invalid, reads "invalid entry"
    * "Editable" state
  3. Accessible Description (via aria-describedby or title if the former does not exist):
    * Description prop
  4. Field value

### Additional Notes and Considerations

* This component is required for bringing in the style for all form controls/inputs. It should be flexible enough for various cases such as:
  * when the label is hidden
* This component may manage the form field (and associated buttons) disabled/readonly/error states, but does its best to get out of the way if the application wants to manage those states directly on the slotted elements.
* Overlays and attached buttons are currently handled by child component, `cbp-form-field-wrapper`
* TODO: Handling of groups of inputs can be done via role=group or a legend tag. The legend tag can accept a disabled attribute, which is an advantage.
* When autocomplete/autofill is used to fill the field, the browser adds styling (only visible in light mode).
* Textareas now support `field-sizing: content`, which causes the textarea to expand vertically to the size of its content (within the bounds of min- and max-heights). This may not be desireable as a default, but could make a useful option.
* Additional notes on slotted form fields and their use, since these are not strictly controlled by the design system:
  * Some input types, such as `email`, `tel`, and `url`, should not be used because they invoke browser-based validation, which is inconsistent across browsers and with the design system, and not always accessible.
  * Use `inputmode` instead of HTML5 input types to provide a browser hint for the proper virtual keyboard on mobile devices without side effects noted above.
  * The `select` with `multiple` (and `size`) attribute should not be used, as they have terrible usability. Use our `cbp-multiselect` (coming soon) instead.
  * Input types such as `date`, `datetime` (deprecated), `datetime-local`, `month`, `week`, `time` may also vary by browser and not be styleable in accordance with the design system.
  * Use of the `size` attribute is discouraged as it does not represent a linear/consistent scale across input sizes and browsers.
    * Furthermore, `size` is not valid on some input types such as `type="number"`.
    * When necessary, it is recommended to use CSS to style the width of form fields (using a relative unit such as `ch` or `rem`) separate from their containers.
