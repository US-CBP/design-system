# cbp-app

## Purpose

The App component is a wrapper that packages high level design tokens (as CSS variables), styles, and fonts as well as acting as top level control for things like dark mode within the design system/component library.

## Functional Requirements

* The App component contains necessary high-level CSS and fonts to remove the need for external dependencies referenced by HTML `link` tags.
* As the highest level container of the application, system-wide functionality may be hoisted to this tag, such as dark mode, debugging, etc. (TBD)

## Technical Specifications

### User Interactions

* By setting the `theme` property, the application may be set to light or dark mode independently of the user's operating system settings.
* By setting the `debug` property to true, debug info will be logged to the console, including:
  * Application name, if specified
  * Application version, if specified
  * Design System version
  * StencilJS version

### Responsiveness

### Accessibility

### Additional Notes and Considerations

* The `cbp-app` component is hidden in most component stories but is still present as a wrapper to load the required CSS and fonts. See the "Page Template" stories for examples where this component is exposed in the story markup.
* TODO: investigate options for dark mode, debugging, performance, etc.
