# cbp-toast

## Purpose

* Toast is intended to temporarialy display messages to users such as error or warning messages about an form input, or confrimation of a file upload. It is the intent of the designer that for things
like error messages to also be populated elsewhere in app so that they don't get 'lost'. 

## Functional Requirements

* Toast expects for users to define the below props/slots
    *Props:
        *Icon: sets the name prop for the icon in the sidebar. default value of 'user'
        *timer: provides 3 options (3sec, 5sec, or 10sec) which determines how long the toast will be visible. if this is not set the toast will persist, which is intended for development, not final 
            User experience
        *color: provides 4 options (info, success, warning, & danger) defaulting to info. determines the color palette used for the background & text color for the toast
    *Slots:
        *title: Slot for the title section of the Toast, intended for text or typography tags
        *content: Slot for the content of the toast, used for description of error or progress bar for example. 
        *buttons: Slot intended for 1 or 2 buttons, UX design intended for these to be a dismiss (of the toast) and/or a button to link to log/more detailed section explaining the toast

## Technical Specifications

### User Interactions

* Toast is intended to temporarialy draw attention to items/actions for the user as such they are meant to have an internal timer to display & have the displayed content in a log elsewhere for user to
    review after the toast is gone. 

### Responsiveness

* Toast's width is set to the max-content of the toast, with a max-width on the toast of 50% of the viewportS 

### Accessibility

* Toast being on a timer is an Accessibility concern, which is why it is advised to have a log of toasts perserved elsewhere in the app as mentioned above
* Slotted content is Accessibile via keyboard, primarily use being the slotted buttons
