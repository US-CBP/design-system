# cbp-pagination

## Purpose

The Pagination component presents a common UI pattern for displaying data sets broken up into smaller, more consumable (and performant) "pages."

## Functional Requirements

* The Pagination component accepts slotted controls for the number of items per page and page selection.
  * The number of items per page dropdown may be customized by the application with whatever values are desired.
  * The page selection dropdown is slotted by the application, but controlled (updated) by the pagination component based on the total records and number of items per page.
* The text describing the items shown is determined by these values and generate by the pagination component.
* The Pagination component does not handle displaying the data.
  * The Pagination component emits events as hooks for application logic whenever the controls are changed.
  * Changes to the component properties such as records, pagesize, and page are reactive and will cause the pagination component to re-render.

## Technical Specifications

### User Interactions

* Changes to the "items per page" dropdown will cause the "items shown" text and "pages" dropdown to be recalculated.
* Changes to the "pages" dropdown will cause the "items shown" text to be recalculated and emit an event to the application to update the data displayed.

### Responsiveness

* The Pagination component is a container with its children laid out using Flexbox and will expand and contract as needed.
* When the viewport width is under 480px (30rem), the "items per page" dropdown will be hidden, as they cannot all fit horizontally on the screen.

### Accessibility

* TBD

### Additional Notes and Considerations

* Applications with access to large data sets should never return the entire data set to the front-end framework or UI.
  * "Chunking" data involves returning part of the data set (whether from a database or API) that is needed for display rather than the entire data set.
  * When paginating such large data sets, the "All Records" options should be omitted from the items per page dropdown.
  * If "All Records" is selected for a data set over 500 records, a warning will be posted to the browser console as a reminder.
