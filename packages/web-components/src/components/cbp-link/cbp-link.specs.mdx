# cbp-link

## Purpose

The Link component renders (or wraps) an anchor for navigation styled in accordance to the design system.

## Functional Requirements

* The Link component API should support native anchor functionality and accessibility.
* An anchor may be supplied as slotted content rather than rendered by the web component.
* The styling provided by the Link component is meant for standard in-content links; not special cases such as navigation links, which may be styled differently and may have more appropriate components built for those situations.
 
## Technical Specifications

### User Interactions

* A link is meant for navigation via http-get, which can be to a new page, to an element on the same page (in-page anchor), or a router event.
  * The first two options are native functionality determined by the `href` property or overridden by a custom event handler.
  * Routing must be handled by application logic and is not built into this web component.
* The Link component emits a custom `linkClick` event when activated.
* In the event that a navigation event needs to be canceled, this must be done via the anchor's native `click` event.
* A disabled link is represented by `aria-hidden="true"` with a `role="link"` and contains no `href` attribute.

### Responsiveness

* Links are inline elements by default and should wrap, making them flexible at any screen size.

### Accessibility

* A disabled link is represented by `aria-hidden="true"` with a `role="link"` and contains no `href` attribute.
* An anchor with no `href` is a non-interactive element. It cannot be focused, is not styled like a link, and often presents accessibility issues.
* Specifying alternate text via the `accessibilityText` property renders this text as an `aria-label` on the anchor.
* `accessibilityText` is required when a link contains only an icon (without its own accessible label) or when the link text is not sufficiently descriptive and uniquely identifiable.

### Additional Notes and Considerations

* An anchor may be supplied as slotted content rather than rendered by the web component. This requirement supports frameworks that use component-based routers, such as React or Vue.
* TODO: investigate side effects and edge cases pertaining to "disabled" links.
  * Are any interactive styles still inherited?
  * Does a mouse click still emit a click event?
  * How can this support a slotted link?
